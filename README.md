# 20 Solver

A simple web project called *20 Solver* with *Brute force Algorithm* for Educational Purposes

Link website [20 Solver](https://20-solver-six.vercel.app/)

## Features

- Input four numbers to strat the solver
- Filter results using set to avoid duplicate expressions with the same results
- Reset and random for better user experience
- User-friendly interface


## Tech Stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Installation (Local)

Step by step to do :

1. *Clone* repository to your local
```bash
git clone https://raaflii/20-solver.git
```

2. *Open* index.html file in your browser
3. You can do whatever you want :)

## Algorithm

This solver uses *Brute Force Algorithm* to generate all combinations of four numbers and four operators (+, -, *, /) including bracket. After that, the algorithm checks whether the result of the combination is 20. If yes, the solution is displayed in the interface.
